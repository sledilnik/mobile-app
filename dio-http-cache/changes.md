# Changes to the original

This is a [fork from a PR](https://github.com/hurshi/dio-http-cache/pull/32) from the [original library]((https://github.com/hurshi/dio-http-cache)). The fork introduces etag enabled caching and even contributes a PR to the original library. The PR is still open at the time being hence using the fork.
